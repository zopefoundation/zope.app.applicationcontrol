--------------------------

- Added missing (normal and test) dependencies.

- Renenabled functional tests.

Version 3.5.0 (2009-05-23)
--------------------------

- The application controller is now registered as a utility so that other
  packages like zope.traversing and zope.app.publication do not need

  controller pluggable.

  egg rather than a checkout.

  machine with a locale different than English.
  See http://launchpad.net/bugs/177733

  the new location.
